Android Basic Arithmetic Calculator
This is a simple Android application that functions as a basic arithmetic calculator. It supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input their calculations, and the app will display the result.

Features
Perform basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /
Clear the input with a "Clear" button.
Shows the result when "=" is pressed.
Error handling for invalid input or calculations.
Screenshots
(Optional: You can include screenshots of the app's UI here if you want to make the README more visually appealing.)

Requirements
Android Studio (for development)
A physical Android device or an emulator to run the app
Android API level 21 or higher (recommended)
Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone or Download the Repository
Clone the repository using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/android-basic-calculator.git
Or, you can download the project as a ZIP file.

2. Open the Project in Android Studio
Open Android Studio.
Select "Open an existing Android Studio project".
Navigate to the folder where you cloned/downloaded the project.
Open the project directory.
3. Build and Run the Application
Once the project is loaded in Android Studio, click on the "Run" button or use the shortcut Shift + F10 to build and run the app.
Select a physical device or start an emulator to run the app.
After a successful build and deployment, the calculator app should launch on your Android device or emulator.

Project Structure
1. activity_main.xml (Layout)
This file contains the layout for the calculator app. It includes:

A EditText widget for displaying the result.
A GridLayout for organizing the number and operator buttons.
2. MainActivity.java (Activity Logic)
This is the main Java file containing the logic for the calculator:

Button click listeners for digit and operation buttons.
Logic for handling arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
A simple expression evaluator for calculating the result.
3. Gradle Files
These files manage project dependencies and build settings.

build.gradle (Project) - Project-wide settings.
build.gradle (Module) - App-specific settings and dependencies.
How to Use
Enter a Calculation:

Tap on number buttons (0-9) to input a number.
Tap on the operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to select the operation.
Calculate the Result:

Once you've entered the full calculation (e.g., 5 + 3), tap the = button to display the result.
Clear the Input:

Tap the C button to clear the input and reset the calculator.
Example Usage
To add two numbers, for example, 7 + 3:

Tap 7, tap +, tap 3, and then tap =.
The result will show 10.
To subtract 8 - 4:

Tap 8, tap -, tap 4, and then tap =.
The result will show 4.
Known Issues
The expression evaluator currently only handles simple arithmetic expressions (no parentheses or advanced operations).
Division by zero may cause unexpected behavior or an error message.

Future Enhancements
Improved Expression Evaluation: Add support for more complex expressions, such as parentheses, decimal numbers, and scientific operations.
Better Error Handling: Improve error handling for invalid inputs or edge cases (e.g., division by zero).
UI/UX Enhancements: Add themes or animations to enhance user experience.
